ConnectTel_Customer_Churn Project

Project Description

The ConnectTel_Customer_Churn Project is designed to address the significant challenge of customer churn faced by ConnectTel Telecom Company. Customer churn represents a critical threat to the company's business sustainability and growth, as existing customer retention strategies lack precision and effectiveness. This project aims to develop a robust customer churn prediction system using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques. By accurately forecasting customer churn, ConnectTel can implement targeted retention initiatives to minimize the loss of valuable customers to competitors.
